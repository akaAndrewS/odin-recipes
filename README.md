This project is to exercise my understanding of HTML basics as well as Git and GitHub basics.

All directories and files were created using the CLI.

index.html has an unordered list of the three recipies created for this project.
The three HTML files all contain the basic recipe for a different type of dish. They include:
- Various headings
- Pictures of the dish, along with an "alt" attribute for screen readers
- A paragraph with a brief description
- An unordered list of ingredients
- An ordered list of steps to make the dish
